Genova is a tool that enables people with disabilities to use computers easily without complications. The tool is based on artificial intelligence and is built in the Python language.

The tool facilitates many uses for people with disabilities in using the computer. It is really reliable and contains many features that are not found in other applications.

It relies entirely on artificial intelligence, facial and voice recognition algorithms, and requires a camera and microphone to start using it

The application relies on voice commands and facial movements to move the mouse cursor and give various commands to the computer, as well as converting speech into written text to help disabled to write messages with their voice without using a keyboard 

A pre-trained ML model was used to recognize the face and voice. The Haar cascade algorithm was used to determine the frontal face to move the mouse, because it is fast and suitable for working in real time.
